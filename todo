Mobile friendly

DAY: pull from current date

User can toggle game mode (paused), and links become informational when not in game mode; controls up top by Day; stats to right of controls; nav fixed to top

LEFT COLUMN: Multiple choice years in random order (stacked on left in larger than mobile window; row of 4 columns on top of Events column in mobile window
	-default gamemode is year
	-order of 4 choices chronological
	-if event is within last 10 years, all four choices must be as well; if there aren't enough events w/in last 10 years, randomize year not matching any of the other three choices
	-highlight green if correct answer chosen (clicked on)
	-highlight red if incorrect answer chosen; user gets two more tries to guess correctly;
	- 4 points if correct, 2 for guessing right on second try, 1 for guessing right on the third try

RIGHT COLUMN: Events (NOTE EVENT MODE IS SECONDARY PRIORITY TO YEAR MODE); 
	-in event mode; if event-mode is triggered, repopulate year (with single year) and random events;
	-if event is w/in last 10 years, all four events listed must be w/in last 10 years; w/in last 50 years, all four must be from within 20 years of each other, or next best window;
	-Same highlighting as above

PAUSED/INFO Mode
	- INFO Box dynamically injected above events
	- clicking on a year populates infobox with list of events in that year (needs close button)
	- clicking on a linked part of event will populate the summary/synopsys info from the wikipedia article, along with the picture if one is provided
	- player can click on more info, which will redirect to the full wikipedia article
	- any time game is paused/switched to info mode, user gets 0 score on the question if they open the info box;

STATS (in fixed top nav):
	- score
	- questions attempted (as fraction);
	- average (score out of total available (score/questions attempted * 4))
	- can pull down expanded information with score for questions attempted, year and event;
	//future: ability to share this info with a friend (both)

organization:
	array of event objects; properties:
		- year
		- event - stringified html (so links function)
		- createGuessYear: creates question with MC years
		- createGuessEvent: creates question with MC events
		- score - num (defaults to 4; degraded based on performance;
		- question attempted: boolean reflecting whether question was tried yet (false by default)
		- summary: upper section
		- OPTIONAL: image; include image if available; (scale to small size);
